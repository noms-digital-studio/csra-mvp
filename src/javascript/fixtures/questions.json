This is because you are similar in a number of ways to people who have been violent in prisons in the past.

This might be because they feel they have to defend themselves, or find themselves in volatile situations, or it might be because repeated victimisation is associated with mental health and behavioral problems, which can sometimes lead to violence.\nIf you consider the person to be at risk of harm if they share a cell with someone, then this will result in a recommendation of single cell allocation."

There are lots of possible reasons for this. For some it might be involvement in the illicit economy, dealing or getting into debt. For others, their drug use might affect their thinking, making them more suspicious and hostile, or might stop them thinking things through and controlling their impulses. Violence can also result from drug-induced psychosis.\nAs lots of people who come to prison take or have recently taken drugs, on its own this risk factor will not lead to a single cell allocation. However, when this is combined with other risk factors, it can lead to the recommendation that it would be safer to house them in a single cell."
