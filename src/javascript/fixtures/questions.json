There are lots of possible reasons for this. For some it might be involvement in the illicit economy, dealing or getting into debt. For others, their drug use might affect their thinking, making them more suspicious and hostile, or might stop them thinking things through and controlling their impulses. Violence can also result from drug-induced psychosis.\nAs lots of people who come to prison take or have recently taken drugs, on its own this risk factor will not lead to a single cell allocation. However, when this is combined with other risk factors, it can lead to the recommendation that it would be safer to house them in a single cell."
